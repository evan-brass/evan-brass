# Evan Brass
Hi!  I'm Evan, a web developer.  I live near [mountains](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ubGZ9KjqafjHQJbQ7)... but I mostly stay indoors.

Most days, you'll find me hacking on some browser API: webaudio, webgl, webassembly, webxr, webrtc, webpush, service-worker, webworkers, etc.  Rust and JavaScript (client or server side) are where I feel most productive, but I can probably dust off some C, C++, Java, PHP, or Python skills in a pinch.

## Mentorship
The internet can be a thick inky black void sometimes.  You whisper into it and it may or may not answer your call.  If you'd like to summon someone out of the void, you can put something on my [calendar](https://calendar.app.google/cxSkbDFmwcmoGP4o8).  In plain words: I'm interested in meeting people and maybe trying to mentor them.  We can chat, program, debug, or whatever.

If you're the kind of person that reads an invitation like that and thinks, "Sure that's available, but it's not really intended for me.  He's probably over-subscribed and if everyone took advantage of it, then there wouldn't be enough - so I'll just manage on my own." then please know that I have a special place in my heart for you.  You and I are cut from the same cloth.  Please click the link above, and if there's no time available, then send me an email and I'll make time for you.

## Interests
There's a Raspberry Pi 3B+ kicking around my desk that was purchased with the express intention of writing an operating system from scratch, but then I learned that the Arm64 core was just a side show on the Broadcom GPU and then I got stuck trying to do VideoCore 4 programming in Rust.  That's a project that I'd like to resume someday.

Most of my web-development has been purely static sites, but I've always wanted to add dynamic user content to a purely static site using a webrtc overlay network.  That's my current project: WONK (the Web Overlay Network Kit).  My first attempt (web3.0-test) was just signalling webrtc over webpush, and it kinda sorta worked - but wasn't satisfactory.  I'd love to see a future that isn't federated, but fully distributed.  Where you visit a website which installs a PWA that interacts in an overlay network and anyone can write their own node software by writing a simple static site.

I used to work in tech support, and I would open links in the phishing emails people would forward to us to see if I could hack them.  Despite trying, I've never successfully hacked anything in my life.

I'm perpetually scruffy, but when I do shave I use a double edged safety razor.  Fountain pens spark my joy.  If you see crimson splotches on my hands it's probably not blood - it's probably ink.
